[mod-setting-description]
import-include-rotated-tiles=Includes rotated version of each tile when reading a sample. More variety, easier to fill the grid 
import-skip-intermediate-tiles=Defines how the tiles are extracted, set to TRUE for predefined tilesets. Example: take a sample of 6x3 with tile size 3. TRUE will read 2 tiles side by side (1-3 and 4-6 on X axis). FALSE will read 4 tiles (1-3, 2-4, 3-5, 4-6 on X axis) 
import-tile-size=Tile size to use when extracting tiles from a sample
import-remove-duplicates=Set to FALSE if you have a tileset with tiles that have same border connections but different inner structure
import-include-reflected-tiles=Includes reflected version of each tile when reading a sample. More variety, easier to fill the grid 

wfc-chunk-size=Set to lower value to improve performance
wfc-solve-attempts-limit=Total time to look for a solution, set to higher if you use complex sample that fails often
wfc-solve-attempts-per-tick=Set to lower value to improve performance

render-spread-tiles=Place results one empty tile apart (for debug mostly)
render-overlap-tiles=Produces more dense patterns by removing duplicated border between tiles
render-avoid-buildings=Skip the area under buildings
render-outline-buildings=Place flat floor under buildings
render-preserve-existing-tiles=Whether to preserve existing tiles or override whole area
